            <p>In this project, you'll make an event invite for an event- a party, a workshop, a wedding, whatever you want. It should have event title, details, and maybe it'd have a guest list or RSVP button.</p>

<p>Before you start coding, I encourage you to "prototype" it - to plan it out either on paper or with a "prototyping" tool. Sketch out the vision you have in your head and go through a few prototypes until you're happy.</p>

<p>Then, when you're ready, try to implement your event invite in HTML/CSS. If you get stuck on something that's hard to transfer from paper to HTML, try searching on the internet or clicking "Request Help." I bet you'll learn something from the process.</p>
